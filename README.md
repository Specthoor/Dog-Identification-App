# Dog-Identification-App
The project involves developing an algorithm that can detect a dog or a human in an image and estimate the breed of the dog. The goal is to create a mobile or web app that can accept any user-supplied image as input and provide an output that includes an estimate of the dog's breed if a dog is detected and an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling if a human is detected. The algorithm involves a series of models to perform different tasks, including detecting humans and dogs in an image, and classifying the breed of the dog. The project highlights the challenges of creating a real-world application that involves multiple models, and the need to balance accuracy and user experience.
